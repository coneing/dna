# DNA Hashing Prototype (coneing/dna)

This repository contains an experimental exploration of DNA-mimetic hashing using the NU curve and palindromic zero techniques, inspired by water-based computation and Mersenne prime indexing. The code simulates a braided spring model where hashes are generated from geometric intersections, offering a novel approach to data storage and recall without biological application.

## Purpose
- **Research Focus**: Demonstrates theoretical hashing via a physical ribbon braid, leveraging the NU curve's golden spiral properties.
- **Water Compute**: Highlights the use of water flow and light refraction (e.g., green halo effect) as a computational medium, with no electrical reliance.
- **Open Science**: Released under GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later to encourage academic review and advancement.

## Key Features
- **NU Curve**: Maps nodes on a golden spiral, connecting thirds of a 3D cube to form a spring-like structure.
- **Palindromic Hashing**: Uses a zero delimiter to create reversible hash strands, mimicking DNA base pairing.
- **Mersenne Primes**: Indexes up to 194,064,501, with potential expansion, guided by Gaussian wave patterns.

## Usage
- Clone the repo and run the provided Python script (`dna_hash_braid.py`) to generate sample hashes.
- No hardware required for initial simulation; physical prototypes (e.g., wet ribbon) are optional.

## Invitation
Universities and researchers are encouraged to verify the mathematical proofs (e.g., Lucas-Lehmer tests for large primes) and explore non-biological applications. Contact via GitHub issues for collaboration.

## Notes
- **Ethics**: Inspired by natural flow (water returns to nature), this project avoids bio-synthesis or food modification.
- **Amusement**: The green halo effect adds a playful nod to nature's computation.
- **Ownership**: No ownership claimedâ€”science is free to evolve here.
